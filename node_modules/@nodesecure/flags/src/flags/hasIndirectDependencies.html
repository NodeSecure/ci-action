    <p>
        The package has indirect (or also called transitive) dependencies. This
        means that the child dependencies of the package also have dependencies.

    <p>
        In the following example <b>accepts</b> is flagged ðŸŒ² because
        <b>mime-types</b> has a <b>mime-db</b> dependency which
        mean that the package is an indirect dependency of <b>accepts</b>.
